        <h2>Privacy Policies</h2>
        <p>Let’s cut to the chase. <br> We know you don’t read those privacy policies you sign. <br> While the simple act of checking that little box may seem harmless, companies often slip questionable agreements into privacy policies, putting your online safety at risk. Just by scribbling in a couple of words underneath a subheading buried 56 pages deep, a company can suddenly sell your biometric data to third-parties that you’ve never even heard of. 
          Don’t think these clauses actually exist? Maybe you just haven’t taken the time to find them.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>On the next page, you will be greeted with a small section of a privacy policy to help you get started with this activity. Your mission is to read through it and click on the section of the policy that clearly puts your internet privacy at risk. While this first activity may seem easy, once you have completed it you will then be able to choose between three longer privacy policies to really test your skills!</p>

          <h2>What Does This Mean?</h2>
          <p>Even though you may not have realized it, chances are extremely high you’ve signed over this type of information to a corporation at least once; maybe you’ve even signed this company's privacy policy! Not only do corporations often sell this information to third-parties for advertising purposes, but if that corporation is hacked that information can easily fall into the wrong hands. Since these companies and individuals can use this compromised information to hack into services such as your bank account or governmental services it is imperative that you protect it.</p>
          <h2>What You Can Do?</h2>
          <p>If you use services on the internet, keeping all of your data out of the hands of companies is next to impossible. As such, the next best thing you can do is ensure that you are aware of what data you are giving out to companies. While you may not have the time to read those privacy policies, there’s still a lot you can do. You can use a password manager to ensure that you don’t reuse passwords for logins, you can click “disallow” when services attempt to gain access to information such as your location, and when signing up a new website do a quick internet check to see if the service is reputable.</p>
