        <h2>Privacy Policies</h2>
        <p>I'm sure you read all the privacy policies you sign, right? It's very easy for companies to slip questionable agreements into them, which is a major threat to your privacy. For example, a company can collect your biometric data if you check the box, even if they just say that in one little sub-sub-heading on page thirty-eight. This demo demonstrates how hard companies can make it to know your privacy rights. </p>

          <h2>What Does This Mean</h2>
          <p>Companies like TikTok collect information like your attention span to certain types of videos along with information like your birthday. If this information were to be released through a hack, information like your birthday and password that are reused on other websites could allow for hackers to access other accounts of yours.</p>
          <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
          <p>Ensure that any information you are giving out to companies, you would not care if it was released to the public, such as your password and email. Also do not reuse passwords! Hackers scan through websites seeing if previously used emails and passwords also work on different sites, and then do various malicious things with your data.</p>
